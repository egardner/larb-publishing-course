            <p>The Los Angeles Review of Books / USC Publishing Workshop is an immersive,
            collaborative publishing workshop designed for students and innovators
            interested in playing a role in the future of publishing. This holistic training
            seminar equips students with skills in both digital and print publishing and is
            unique among publishing seminars in its focus on producing live ventures by the
            summer’s end. The Los Angeles Review of Books / USC Publishing Workshop is a
            vanguard, real-world program whose graduates will go on to be among the most
            well-trained, experienced, competitive, and inventive in the industry.</p>
            
            <p>The Course gives students a foundation in both traditional and future platforms,
            as they attend lectures, seminars, and boot camps in book, magazine, and online
            editing; digital and print publishing; SEO and audience metrics; and the
            financial and business side of publishing. Students will learn from a broad
            selection of experts who specialize in various aspects of the publishing
            industry, including editors, art directors, book historians, literary agents,
            marketing professionals, published writers, academic publishers, web coders,
            developers, and digital innovators. The signature project of the Course is a
            real world, hands-on practicum: the creation of a print magazine or website, or
            the development of a business plan for a new publishing enterprise that is ready
            either for direct funding or for research and development funding.</p>
            
            <p><img alt="" src="assets/images/at-work.jpg" /></p>
            
            <p>Students interested in print publishing will participate in staffing and
            co-publishing an annual Workshop print edition which features original content
            students acquire, curate, and edit specifically for the publication. This
            publication, to be named and branded by Workshop participants, is both an online
            Los Angeles Review of Books Channel and a print edition, distributed in Los
            Angeles and shipped to LARB Members.</p>
            
            <p>Students will collaborate in cohorts, each of which will also generate a new
            publishing project and develop a business plan and funding proposal for that
            project. These students will work with program faculty and visiting industry
            experts to bring those projects into being, receiving the instruction they need
            and training in the tools and skillsets necessary to achieve real-world results.
            By the end of the Workshop, students will have participated in producing a
            viable publication or proposal, using the expertise they developed.</p>
            
            <p>Students will be in residence at USC for five weeks, from <strong>June 26 – July 29,</strong>
            committing to a series of preparatory assignments before arriving in Los
            Angeles.</p>
